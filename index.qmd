## Overview {.unnumbered}

The **Odin-Monty Workshop** is a collaborative event designed to showcase the second generation of odin-monty tools and bring together modellers from diverse fields, as well as those working at the interface between modelling and other disciplines. Participants will explore new features, see real-world use cases, and gain insights from others working in similar domains.

## Workshop Aims {.unnumbered}

- Introducing the updated [odin-monty](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin-monty/) toolkit
- Building a community and fostering collaboration
- Collecting feedback to guide further refinement

By actively involving attendees, the odin-monty team aims to ensure these tools evolve in step with community needs and emerging trends.

## Lightning Talks {.unnumbered}

On 24 March 2025 (15:30–16:30 UK time), we will host an online/hybrid session, “Lightning talks – odin applications in practice.” You can register for this session if you are unable to travel to London or if you are primarily interested in the talks.

## Slide decks

In the interactive sessions, we will work through two slide decks:

* Monday AM: [writing odin code](slides/odin.html)
* Monday PM: [fitting odin models to data](slides/fitting.html)

Slide decks from talks will be added to the [agenda](agenda.qmd) for future reference.

## Installation instructions

We strongly recommend version 4.4.x of R; older versions may work (and in particular 4.3.x is known to work).

For the interactive session, you will need recent versions of `odin2`, `monty` and `dust2`, which you can install from our R-universe:

```r
install.packages(
  c("monty", "dust2", "odin2"),
  repos = c("https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

You will also need a working C++ toolchain; you can test if you have one by running

```{r}
pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE)
```

If this fails, you should follow instructions for your platform:

* Windows: Install "RTools", for 4.4.x of R see [these instructions](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html)
* macOS: Install the XCode command line tools following [these instructions](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/)
* Linux: This varies by distribution, and most users will likely have everything they need if they can install any packages.
