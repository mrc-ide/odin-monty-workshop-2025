## WIFI

- EDUROAM
- for non-Academic participants **The Cloud**
Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the college via Sky Wi-Fi via The Cloud. Connect to The Cloud by searching for Wi-Fi networks on your device, connecting to the '_The Cloud' network and following the instructions that show on screen. 

# A brief history of odin

## "Classic" odin - the beginnings (2016-2019)

- **`odin`** created to integrate ODEs (e.g. for compartmental models) in R with a domain-specific language (DSL)
- Limited support for difference (discrete-time) equations
- Automatic translation to C; efficient solutions in little code
- Used at Imperial for malaria, HIV, ebola and other diseases
- No support for inference

## COVID-19 response (2020-2022)

## COVID-19 response (2020-2022)

- **`mcstate`** for statistical machinery (particle filter, pMCMC)
- **`dust`** for efficient parallel simulation
- **`odin.dust`** compile `odin` code to use `dust`
- Collaborative work by the UK real-time modelling & research software engineers teams at Imperial College
- Many, many, rough edges

## Meanwhile...

* Different versions of the stack have been picked up outside of Imperial
  - Zurich, Munster, LSHTM, CDC, Lancaster, Pasteur, NC State, Norway, Switzerland
* People tried to repurpose statistical machinery in `mcstate`
* We hit limits of computational efficiency and ability to manage inputs and outputs with the COVID model
* The documentation (22 vignettes) and packages (>5) were hard to navigate and discover

# Version 2

- Design of a new architecture, rewiring data, model and parameters
- New statistical interface, **`monty`**
  - A new small BUGS-inspired DSL for priors
  - Works well with `odin` models, but usable on its own
  - Modular, and eventually easy to extend
  - Fully replaces `mcstate`
