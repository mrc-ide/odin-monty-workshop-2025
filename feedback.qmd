## Help Us Improve odin & monty

- **Goal**: Gather actionable feedback based on your experience (including yesterday!)
- **Structure**: Group discussions guided by 4 key themes
- **Outcome**: Identify what works well and where improvements are needed

## Group Setup

1. 🟢 **Novices** (no prior tool experience)
2. 🟡 **Users of other tools** (e.g. Stan, JAGS, BayesTools)
3. 🔵 **odin/mcstate/monty users**
  
- Each group sits at a table of ~10 people.
- Each table has a QR code to capture discussion points in a shared Google Doc

## ⏱️ Format and Timingt

- Each topic gets:
  - **8 minutes** for group discussion
  - **7 minutes** for sharing back with the room
- Please identify if possible:
  - 1 thing you *liked* about the toolkit 
  - 1 thing that *needs improvement*

## Topic 1 – Interface Design

- 🟢 **Novices:** Was it easy to get started? Were any commands confusing?  
- 🟡 **Other tools:** How did odin compare to the tools you're used to?  
- 🔵 **odin users:** How does odin2 differ from earlier versions? Are commands more intuitive now?

## Topic 2 – Documentation & Learning Materials

- 🟢 **Novices:** What resources helped you most? What was hard to find?  
- 🟡 **Other tools:** What formats (videos, cheat sheets, books) do you prefer?  
- 🔵 **odin users:** What parts of the new documentation improved your workflow? What’s still missing?

##  Topic 3 – Work Practice

- 🟢 **Novices:** What kind of problems would you want to use odin for in future?  
- 🟡 **Other tools:** What steps in your current workflow could odin support or replace?  
- 🔵 **odin users:** Which parts of the odin/monty pipeline do you repeatedly use? What slows you down?

## Topic 4 – Community & Ecosystem

- 🟢 **Novices:** Would you find a community helpful? What format (forum, chat, office hours)?  
- 🟡 **Other tools:** What kind of community features do other tools offer that you value?  
- 🔵 **odin users:** How have you engaged with the odin community before? What could enhance collaboration?

## Key Points & Wrap-up
