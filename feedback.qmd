## Help Us Improve odin & monty

- **Goal**: Gather actionable feedback based on your experience (including yesterday!)
- **Structure**: Group discussions guided by 4 key topic (Interface design, Documentation, Work practice, Community)
- **Outcome**: Identify what works well and where improvements are needed

## Group Setup

1. 🟢 **Novices** (no prior tool experience)
2. 🟡 **Users of other tools** (e.g. Stan, JAGS, BayesTools)
3. 🔵 **odin/mcstate/monty users**
  
- Each group sits at a table of ~10 people.
- Each table has a QR code to capture discussion points in a shared Google Doc

## ⏱️ Format and Timing

- Each topic gets:
  - **8 minutes** for group discussion
  - **7 minutes** for sharing back with the room
- Please identify if possible:
  - 1 thing you *liked* about the toolkit 
  - 1 thing that *needs improvement*

# Topics

- 🟡 **Other tools:** How did odin compare to the tools you're used to?

## Topic 2 – Documentation & Learning Materials

##  Topic 3 – Work Practice

- 🟢 **Novices:** What kind of problems would you want to use odin-monty for in future? any task you find repetitive and could automate?
