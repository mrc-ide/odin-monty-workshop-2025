# What is new?

* Since `odin` v1 (classic odin, pre 2020)
  - comparison to data and likelihood support
  - run multiple sets of paramters at once
  - run in parallel

* Since `odin.dust`
  - limited support for automatic differentiation
  - more efficient paramter updating
  - parameter packers
  - better parallelism
  - periodic variable resetting
  - better error messages
  - compile time array bounds checking
  - debugging support

# Syntax changes

* `user()` -> `parameter()`
* Discrete models have a proper time basis, `dt` is now a reserved word
* No longer use R's names for distribution functions
* Named arguments allow clearer code
* Automatic migration support is available!

# Limitations

* Much slower compilation time
* Delays less flexible than in version 1 (cannot be used in discrete time models, the default argument has been removed)

# Practical considerations

* Handful of missing features from `odin` v1 and `dust` v1 (`odin.dust`)
  - delayed delays
  - mixed time models
  - compilation to JavaScript
  - extendable via C++
* The great package migration
  - `dust2` to `dust`
  - `odin2` to `odin` and all onto CRAN

# Planned new features

## GPU support

## MPI support

## Automatic differentiation

## Parallel tempering

## More bounds checking and debugging

## More radical changes to the DSL?
